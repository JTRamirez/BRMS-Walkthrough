# Welcome!

This path is intended to do the following:

* Give a high-level summary of the purpose, benefits and drawbacks of rules engines.
* Explain the fundamentals of installation, integration, and rule authoring with Red Hat's BRMS rules engine solution.
* Provide vetted documentation and other supporting information that can be used as a resource throughout the above steps.

Information will be added or amended as needed in order to fulfill the purpose of providing an informative resource, and as such this should be treated as a living document. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out with comments.

Beyond the modules in the path, there is additionally a _Documentation_ page at the end of the path that provides links to a variety of helpful resources, some of which informed the path itself. If you're finding yourself looking for more information, or asking questions mid-module, it is encouraged that you pull up those resources while going through this path.

Finally, since BRMS is derivative of a variety of open source projects (and depends on others), it's worth listing the most prominent of these:
