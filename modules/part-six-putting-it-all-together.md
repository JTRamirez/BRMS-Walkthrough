### Summary

Fundamentally, a rules engine is:

> A system that is *purpose-built to perform logic*, usually in the form of "When [condition], then [action]".

Rather than encompassing a bunch of application components, rules engines are narrowly focused on the decision-making processes that exist within most apps. Thus, they are meant work alongside applications by centralizing the storage of rules and logic, and then processing data against those rules as needed.

### The final quiz

<!-- @multipleChoice -->

Which of the following is the best definition for a _rules engine_?

- [ ] A platform that stores data and performs calculations for applications.
- [X] A system that stores logic and processes logical operations for applications.
- [ ] An application that can stand-in for many different kinds of other applications.
- [ ] A system that administrates priviliges and access for applications, systems, and users.

What is Node.js?

- [ ] A package manager for JavaScript packages
- [ ] A front-end framework for heavy-traffic web applications
- [X] A platform for scalable network applications
- [ ] A system that administrates priviliges and access for applications, systems, and users.

Remember that Node.js is more powerful than any individual use that it can be associated with.
